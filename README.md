## Error Handling

The API uses consistent error responses:

```json
{
  "success": false,
  "message": "Error message here"
}
```

## Success Responses

All successful responses follow this format:

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": { ... }
}
```

For paginated responses:

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "count": 20,
  "total": 100,
  "pages": 5,
  "currentPage": 1,
  "data": [ ... ]
}
```

## Development

```bash
npm run dev
```

This runs the server with nodemon for auto-restart on file changes.

## Production Deployment

1. Set `NODE_ENV=production` in your environment
2. Use a process manager like PM2:
   ```bash
   npm install -g pm2
   pm2 start server.js --name stock-backend
   ```
